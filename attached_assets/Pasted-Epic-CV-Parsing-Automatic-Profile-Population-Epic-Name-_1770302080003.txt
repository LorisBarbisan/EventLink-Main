Epic: CV Parsing & Automatic Profile Population
Epic Name
CV Content Extraction & Smart Profile Autofill
Epic Description
As a freelancer,
 I want the platform to automatically extract key information from my uploaded CV and populate my profile fields,
 so that I can save time, reduce manual data entry, and create a complete, accurate profile more easily.
As a platform owner,
 I want CV parsing to be reliable, transparent, and user-controlled,
 so that data quality remains high and users trust the automation.

Business Value
Significantly reduces onboarding friction for freelancers


Increases profile completeness and quality


Improves recruiter confidence and search accuracy


Encourages CV uploads (already a key asset on the platform)


Creates foundation for future AI-assisted profile enhancements



🔹 Core Concept
Freelancer uploads a CV (existing feature)


System extracts structured data from the CV


Extracted data is suggested, not forced


Freelancer reviews and confirms before saving


Only relevant profile fields are populated



🧩 User Stories

1️⃣ Story: Trigger CV Parsing After Upload
As a freelancer
 I want my CV to be automatically analysed after upload
 So that the system can extract useful profile information.
Acceptance Criteria
When a freelancer uploads a CV:


System automatically starts CV parsing in the background


Supported file formats:


PDF


DOC / DOCX


Freelancer sees a clear status indicator:


“Analysing your CV…”


“CV analysis complete”


CV parsing does not block other profile actions


Errors are handled gracefully with a fallback message



2️⃣ Story: Extract Key Profile Fields from CV
As a system
 I want to extract structured data from the CV
 So that it can be mapped to freelancer profile fields.
Acceptance Criteria
System attempts to extract the following fields (where available):


Full name


Professional headline / role


Skills


Work experience (job titles + companies)


Education


Certifications (basic detection)


Extraction is best-effort:


Missing fields are ignored


No assumptions are forced


Raw CV content is not displayed to other users



3️⃣ Story: Map Extracted Data to Profile Fields (Draft State)
As a freelancer
 I want extracted CV data to be suggested in my profile
 So that I can review and approve it before it is saved.
Acceptance Criteria
Extracted data is displayed in a review step:


Pre-filled profile fields are clearly marked (e.g. “Suggested from CV”)


Data is shown in editable form fields


No profile field is overwritten automatically without user confirmation


Freelancer can:


Accept all suggestions


Edit individual fields


Reject suggestions entirely



4️⃣ Story: Confirm & Save Extracted Profile Data
As a freelancer
 I want to confirm the extracted information
 So that it becomes part of my public profile.
Acceptance Criteria
“Save profile” action persists accepted extracted data


Only confirmed fields are saved


Rejected fields remain unchanged


Profile updates are reflected immediately in:


Profile page


Search results


Profile previews



5️⃣ Story: Re-run CV Parsing on CV Replacement
As a freelancer
 I want the system to re-analyse my CV when I upload a new one
 So that my profile stays up to date.
Acceptance Criteria
Uploading a new CV triggers a fresh parsing process


Previously extracted data does not auto-overwrite existing profile data


Freelancer is prompted:


“Do you want to update your profile from this CV?”


Freelancer can choose to reapply suggestions or ignore them



6️⃣ Story: Error Handling & Transparency
As a freelancer
 I want to understand what went wrong if CV parsing fails
 So that I’m not confused or blocked.
Acceptance Criteria
If parsing fails:


User sees a clear, friendly error message


Manual profile editing remains available


System logs parsing errors for debugging


No sensitive CV content is exposed in error messages



7️⃣ Story: Permissions, Privacy & Data Safety
As a platform owner
 I want CV parsing to be secure and privacy-compliant
 So that user data is protected.
Acceptance Criteria
CV files are:


Stored securely


Accessible only to authorised users


Parsed data is used only for:


Profile population


Internal processing


CV content is not indexed or publicly exposed


Deleting a CV removes associated parsed data references



🔧 Technical Notes (Optimised for Replit AI Agent)
CV parsing can be implemented via:


Third-party CV parsing API (initial MVP), or


Lightweight text extraction + rule-based parsing


Parsing should be asynchronous (background job / worker)


Store extracted data temporarily (draft state) until confirmed


Map extracted fields carefully to existing profile schema


Ensure parsing is idempotent and repeatable
