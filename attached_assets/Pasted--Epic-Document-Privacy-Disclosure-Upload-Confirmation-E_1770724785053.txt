🔷 Epic: Document Privacy Disclosure & Upload Confirmation
Epic Name

Document Privacy Notice & User Confirmation for Certificate Uploads

Epic Description

As a freelancer,
I want to be clearly informed that uploaded certificates can be viewed by signed-in employers and that personal information should be concealed,
so that I can make an informed decision and protect my privacy.

As a platform owner,
I want explicit disclosure and confirmation at the point of upload,
so that EventLink is transparent, privacy-aware, and compliant with best practice.

Business Value

Improves user trust and transparency

Reduces accidental sharing of personal data (addresses, DOB, NI numbers)

Lowers legal and compliance risk

Aligns with UK GDPR principles (data minimisation, informed consent)

Creates a clear audit trail of user acknowledgement

🔹 Core Concept

Clear static disclosure text in the upload form

A mandatory pop-up reminder shown when the user clicks “Upload”

User must explicitly acknowledge before proceeding

Employers can view documents; sensitive personal data should be concealed

Upload is blocked unless the confirmation is acknowledged

A modal / pop-up is displayed

Upload does not proceed until acknowledged

Pop-up includes:

Clear explanation

Explicit warning about personal data

Single primary confirmation action

UX Copy (Pop-Up Body)

Certificates uploaded to EventLink can be viewed by signed-in employers.

Please make sure you have removed or concealed personal information, including:

Home address

Date of birth

National Insurance number

Any other sensitive personal data

EventLink does not require this information and recommends you hide it before uploading.

3️⃣ Story: Explicit User Acknowledgement Before Upload Proceeds

As a platform owner
I want users to explicitly acknowledge the privacy notice
So that uploads are informed and intentional.

Acceptance Criteria

Pop-up includes a clear confirmation action, e.g.:

Button: “I understand and wish to continue”

Upload proceeds only after the confirmation button is pressed

Closing the modal without confirmation cancels the upload

Confirmation state applies only to the current upload action

4️⃣ Story: Block Upload Until Confirmation Is Given

As a system
I want to prevent document uploads without confirmation
So that privacy guidance cannot be ignored.

Acceptance Criteria

File upload is disabled until:

Pop-up is shown

Confirmation button is clicked

If the user cancels:

No file is uploaded

User is returned to the upload form

Confirmation must be repeated for each upload session

5️⃣ Story: Employer Visibility Clarification

As a freelancer
I want to clearly understand who can see my documents
So that there is no ambiguity about access.

Acceptance Criteria

Disclosure explicitly states:

Documents are visible to signed-in employers

No implication that documents are public

Text does not over-promise security or anonymity

6️⃣ Story: Accessibility & UX Compliance

As a user
I want the notice and pop-up to be accessible
So that I can understand it regardless of device or ability.

Acceptance Criteria

Modal is:

Keyboard navigable

Screen-reader compatible

Text contrast meets accessibility standards

Mobile and desktop layouts are supported

🔧 Technical Notes (Optimised for Replit AI Agent)

Implement modal as a reusable component

Tie confirmation state to the upload action, not user account

Log confirmation event (timestamp + document type) for audit if needed

Do not store or infer any sensitive personal data

Ensure no upload request is sent until confirmation is complete
