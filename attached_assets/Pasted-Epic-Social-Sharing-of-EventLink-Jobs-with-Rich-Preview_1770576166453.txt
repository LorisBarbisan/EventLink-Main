Epic: Social Sharing of EventLink Jobs with Rich Preview
Epic Name

Job Social Sharing & Rich Link Previews

Epic Description

As a recruiter,
I want to quickly share a job I have posted on EventLink via social media and messaging platforms,
so that I can attract suitable freelancers beyond the platform while still driving traffic back to EventLink.

As a platform owner,
I want shared job links to display a rich, professional preview,
so that EventLink jobs look credible, clear, and appealing when shared externally.

Business Value

Increases visibility of EventLink job postings

Drives organic traffic and new user acquisition

Improves job fill rates for recruiters

Strengthens EventLink brand presence on social platforms

Encourages recruiters to promote jobs themselves

🔹 Core Concept

Each job on EventLink has a shareable public URL

Recruiters can generate and copy a share link

When shared on social platforms (LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, X, etc.), the link renders a rich preview:

Job title

Key details (role, location, date)

EventLink branding

Call to action (“View & apply on EventLink”)
